            <h3>Problem:</h3>
            <p>
                India faces a growing NCD crisis, with nearly 70% of deaths linked to unhealthy diets. The rise of Q-commerce, while convenient, has exacerbated this by promoting impulse purchases of ultra-processed foods, ranked among the world's unhealthiest. Current barcode scanner apps are impractical for real-time decision-making.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Solution:</h3>
            <p>
                InSight gamifies healthier food choices by integrating directly with Q-commerce platforms. Our app displays real-time product availability and health scores, based on harmful additives and international standards. Users can personalize scores based on individual health conditions. The app simulates orders in the backend, allowing users to receive their usual 10-minute delivery, but with healthier options.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Business Model:</h3>
    
            <h4>B2C:</h4>
            <p>
                Freemium model: Free health ratings on food items. Premium features include personalized health scores for users with specific medical needs (diabetes, hypertension, etc.), pregnant women, parents, and fitness enthusiasts.
            </p>
    
            <h4>B2B:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Corporate Wellness Programs: Subscriptions for companies to offer employee discounts on healthy orders.</li>
                <li>Insurance Companies: Discounts on healthy orders to reduce claim risks.</li>
                <li>API Licensing: Integration of our health ratings into Q-commerce apps.</li>
            </ul>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <img src="assets/images/TakeCare - 6.gif" alt="TakeCare Step 6 GIF" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
        </div>

        <p>
            Future functionality can include integrating Ola/Uber to and from the hospital and a simple QR code that transfers your medical history to the doctor -- for when you visit a new doctor you haven't before, or in case of emergencies.

            </div>
        
            <h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
            <p>
                Outscal, in its early-stage as a VC-backed startup, needed to rapidly establish a strong online presence and drive user acquisition. The challenge was to achieve significant growth in a cost-effective and highly scalable manner, specifically on YouTube, to attract potential users to the Outscal platform.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Methodology:</h3>
            <p>
                To address this, I developed and implemented a focused YouTube Shorts strategy, leveraging AI assistance to maximize content creation efficiency. This involved:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Full-Cycle Ownership:</b> I managed the entire social media marketing lifecycle, including research, SEO optimization, copywriting, scripting, design, and video editing.</li>
                <li><b>AI-Assisted Content Creation:</b> Employed AI tools to streamline the creation of short-form video content, increasing output and maintaining quality.</li>
                <li><b>Data-Driven Experimentation:</b> Worked directly with the founder to lead rapid data-driven experimentation, continuously analyzing growth and engagement metrics to refine the strategy.</li>
                <li><b>Multi-Platform Management:</b>  Integrated YouTube strategy with management of other social media platforms including LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, and Discord to ensure a cohesive brand presence.</li>
        
            </ul>
        
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 20px;">

                The implemented strategy led to significant results:

            <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
            <p>
                I contributed to the production of "Money Mafia S3," a gripping four-part documentary series that delves into the shadowy underbelly of Mumbai's economy. The series fearlessly uncovers the inner workings of some of India’s most audacious rackets, including extortion, gold smuggling, drug trafficking, and hawala operations, offering viewers an unfiltered look into this sprawling parallel world.
            </p>
        
            <h3>My Role:</h3>
            <p>
                This project marked a significant milestone in my career as a Director’s Assistant. It provided invaluable experience collaborating with VICE and Discovery, two studios renowned for their impactful documentary filmmaking, whose work has long been a source of inspiration for me. My responsibilities spanned across various crucial aspects of production:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>End-to-End Production Management:</b> Oversaw the complete production lifecycle of the series.</li>

                <li><b>Client Communication:</b> Served as a key point of contact for client communication, maintaining clear and effective collaboration.</li>
                <li><b>On-Set Logistics:</b> Handled all on-set logistics, ensuring smooth and efficient filming.</li>
                <li><b>Creative Direction:</b> Directed art and prop coordination to maintain the series' creative vision.</li>

            <h2>Memesys Culture Lab <span class="close-button">×</span></h2>

            <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
            <p>
                During my time at Memesys Culture Lab, I played a key role in developing and producing a series of short reels focused on science communication. These reels aimed to translate complex scientific concepts into engaging and accessible visual narratives for a wider audience. One notable reel was created for the Instagram page of Anand Gandhi, the acclaimed Indian filmmaker, entrepreneur, media producer, innovator, and systems researcher.
            </p>
            <br>

            </div>
        
            <h3>Conceptual Approach:</h3>
            <p>
                The reel created for Anand Gandhi was a 60-second visual exploration of the limitations of perception. Drawing inspiration from Edwin Abbott Abbott’s seminal 1884 book, "Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions," the video offered a thought-provoking perspective on how our understanding of reality is often constrained by our inherent biases and limited viewpoints.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Key Responsibilities:</h3>
            <p>
                Across the science communication reels, including the one for Anand Gandhi, my responsibilities encompassed the full creative and technical process:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Conceptualization and Storyboarding:</b> Developed the core concepts and created visual storyboards to guide the reels' narratives.</li>
                <li><b>Scripting and Copywriting:</b> Crafted concise and impactful text to accompany the visuals, enhancing the reels' message and clarity.</li>
                <li><b>Visual Design and Art Direction:</b> Oversaw the visual aesthetic, ensuring alignment with the project's conceptual goals and maintaining a high level of visual appeal.</li>
                <li><b>Video Editing and Post-Production:</b> Personally edited and produced the final reels, incorporating visual effects, sound design, and music to create polished and engaging pieces.</li>
                <li><b>Platform Optimization:</b> Tailored the reels specifically for various social media platforms (primarily Instagram), considering their format, audience, and best practices.</li>

                "Le Secret De Jihane" is an audio documentary that I created, exploring a captivating moment of discovery in the life of Jihane Bougrine—a multifaceted artist who is a journalist, singer, and songwriter.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Narrative Focus:</h3>
            <p>
                The documentary unravels the story of Jihane's encounter with a profound family secret, which she stumbled upon while immersed in a novel by one of her favorite Moroccan writers. This deeply personal revelation served as the creative spark for the genesis of her brilliant song, "Serek F' Bir."
            </p>
        
            <h3>Collaboration and Recognition:</h3>
